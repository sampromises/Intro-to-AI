# Sam Kim's programming assignments for an introductory artificial intelligence course.

## 1 - Magic Square Solver ([My code](./1_magic_square_solver/magic.py))

This is an implementation of an iterative backtracking algorithm that finds a solution for a NxN magic square, which is an incomplete grid with sum constraints for the rows, columns, and 2 diagonals.

## 2 - Bayes Net Sampling ([My code](./2_bayes_net_sampling/sampling.py))

An exercise in Bayes Net sampling methods by implementing direct, rejection, likelihood, and Gibbs sampling.

## 3 - Flappy Bird Solver, using TensorFlow and Keras ([My code](./3_flappy_bird_solver/RL.py))

Using TensorFlow and Keras APIs to implement a Flappy Bird solver, achieving a high score of 300+.

## 4 - Counterfactual Regret Minimization (My code [here](./4_counterfactual_regret_minimization/mccfr.py) and [here](./4_counterfactual_regret_minimization/cfr_plus.py))

An implementation of the PureCFR and CFR+ algorithms to choose the best strategy in non-perfect imperfect games.
